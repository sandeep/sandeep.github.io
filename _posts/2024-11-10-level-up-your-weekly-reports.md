This post is a follow on to "[Writing crisp weekly reports](/2019-01-22-Weekly-Status-Reports)". Feel free to check that out if you haven't already.  

Level up your weekly updates! 🚀 Imagine comms that don't just inform, they *inspire*.  Where every word sparks action and every message hits the mark.  Ready to ditch the fluff and make some magic? ✨

As a product manager, your communication needs to be 💯.  Why? To keep everyone aligned 🤝, drive product development 🛠️, and build trust and transparency 💎.  But no one wants to wade through a dense, jargon-filled newsletter 😴, self congratulatory tomes or a list of 🚦🚦🚦 updates which don't convey potential risks.  

Here's how to write 🔥 updates that communicate project status crisply, lead to action and drive the results you want:

**1. Outcomes Over Output**

Stop telling us what you're *doing*; tell us what you've *achieved*. Instead of "I had a meeting with XYZ on Wednesday," try "We secured stakeholder buy-in for Feature X." 👍  Focus on what you've *achieved*, not just what you're *doing*.

**2. Facts Beat Fiction**

"Greatly improved" and "huge opportunity" sound impressive, but they're subjective and ultimately meaningless unless we all agree on what those words really mean. Use concrete data and get everyone aligned. Instead of "We saw a huge increase in user engagement," try "User engagement increased by 15% this week." 📈 Numbers speak louder than words!

**3. Action Items over Ambiguity** 

If you need some action taken, be crystal clear about who's responsible and when it's due. Instead of "We'll discuss next steps" 🤷‍♀️,  give clear action items: "John will finalize the design spec by EOD Friday." 📝  Ensure everyone knows what needs to happen and who's responsible.


By following these simple tips, you can transform your product updates from dreaded time-wasters into valuable communication tools that level up your reports and products. ✨
